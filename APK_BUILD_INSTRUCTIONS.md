2. Wait for Gradle sync
3. Go to **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**
4. APK will be in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`

**Option B: Using Command Line**
```bash
# Clean and build
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug

# APK will be generated at:
# app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

### Step 3: Install and Test
